# personal leetcode solutions

I'll adjust the repository as I work with it, but the main usage of this is to store some of my practice problem sets. For now I'm just going to organize based off the programming languages I complete specific problems in. I'll try to commit to this repository (aka practice different problems) as much as I can.
